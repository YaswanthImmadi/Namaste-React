(1) Is JSX mandatory for React ?

        No, JSX (JavaScript XML) is not mandatory for React, but it is the most commonly used way to define the 
        structure of your React components and elements. React doesn't require JSX to function; it can also be used 
        with plain JavaScript or other templating languages.

(2) Is ES6 mandatory for React?

        ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is not mandatory for React, but it is highly recommended and widely used in the 
        React ecosystem. React itself does not depend on a specific version of ECMAScript, and you can write React
         code using older versions of JavaScript if necessary.

(3) How can i write comments in JSX?

        for single line comments use //
        for multi line comments use {/* *\}

(4) what is <ReactFragment></ReactFragment> and <></> ?

        In React, both <React.Fragment> and <> (a shorter syntax) are used to create a container for multiple elements without introducing an additional DOM element. This is often necessary when you want to return multiple elements from a component's render method or function, as a component can only return a single element or component.

        Here's the key difference between <React.Fragment> and <> (a.k.a. "empty angle brackets" or "short syntax"):

        Syntax:

        <React.Fragment>: This is the long-form syntax for creating a fragment. You explicitly use the 
        <React.Fragment> element as a wrapper for your elements.
        <> (Short Syntax): This is a shorter, more concise syntax introduced in React 16.2. It allows you to 
        create a fragment using empty angle brackets, which is more concise and visually cleaner.
        jsx
        Copy code
        // Using <React.Fragment>
        <React.Fragment>
        <div>Element 1</div>
        <div>Element 2</div>
        </React.Fragment>

        // Using <>
        <>
        <div>Element 1</div>
        <div>Element 2</div>
        </>
        Both methods achieve the same result, but <> is preferred for its brevity.

        The primary reason for using fragments is to avoid adding unnecessary DOM elements to the page. 
        Wrapping elements in a fragment ensures that you don't introduce an extra parent element in the DOM tree,
         which can be useful for styling and layout purposes.

        Here's an example illustrating how fragments are used in a component's render method:

        jsx
        import React from 'react';

        function MyComponent() {
        return (
            <>
            <h1>Title</h1>
            <p>Paragraph 1</p>
            <p>Paragraph 2</p>
            </>
        );
        }
        In the above example, the <> (or <React.Fragment>) is used to wrap multiple elements without creating 
        a new parent element in the DOM. This can help maintain a clean and logical DOM structure while rendering
         multiple elements in a React component.

        *****
        There is one key difference between <React.Fragment> and <> (the short syntax) in React, and
         it is related to the ability to assign keys to fragments when mapping over arrays of elements. 
         This difference is specific to the long-form <React.Fragment>.

        In the short syntax <>, key assignment is not supported. Here's the difference:

        Key Assignment:

        <React.Fragment>: With the long-form syntax, you can assign keys to the fragment.
         This can be useful when you are mapping over an array of elements and React requires keys to uniquely
          identify each element.
        jsx
        Copy code
        <React.Fragment key={someKey}>
        <div>Element 1</div>
        <div>Element 2</div>
        </React.Fragment>
        <> (Short Syntax): The short syntax <> does not support assigning keys directly to the fragment. If you
         need to assign keys to elements within a fragment, you should use the long-form syntax with <React.Fragment>.
        So, if you need to assign keys to the elements within the fragment, you would use <React.Fragment> 
        instead of <>. Otherwise, for most cases where you don't need to assign keys, there's no functional 
        difference between them, and the choice between <React.Fragment> and <> is based on coding style and 
        personal preference.


(5) what is virtual DOM ?

        The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used in web development frameworks like React to optimize the performance 
        of updating the user interface (UI). It's a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual Document 
        Object Model (DOM) of a web page. The primary purpose of the Virtual DOM is to improve efficiency when 
        rendering changes to the UI.

        In summary, the Virtual DOM is a critical optimization technique used in React and similar frameworks to make 
        UI updates more efficient and to ensure that web applications remain responsive and performant, 
        even as they become more complex.

(6) What is Reconciliation in React ?

        Reconciliation in React refers to the process of efficiently updating the Document Object Model (DOM) to
         reflect changes in the application's state or data. React's reconciliation algorithm is responsible for 
         comparing the current state of a component's Virtual DOM (VDOM) representation with its previous state and 
         making the necessary updates to the actual DOM to reflect these changes.


(7) What is React Fiber?

        React Fiber, also known as the "Fiber Architecture," is a fundamental reimplementation of React's core algorithm for rendering user 
        interfaces. It was introduced to React in version 16 to improve the performance and responsiveness of React applications. Fiber allows 
        React to perform more efficient reconciliation of the Virtual DOM and to better manage the rendering of complex and time-consuming 
        components.

        The key features and benefits of React Fiber include:

        Incremental Rendering: Fiber introduces the concept of "work-in-progress" and allows React to work on rendering small chunks of work
         at a time. This enables React to be more responsive and avoid blocking the main thread for extended periods. As a result, applications 
         can remain smooth and responsive even when dealing with complex UI updates.

        Priority Reconciliation: Fiber provides a priority system for scheduling work. It categorizes different types of work
         (e.g., rendering, animation, user input handling) into priorities. React can then adjust its schedule to ensure that high-priority work,
          such as user interactions, is processed quickly and doesn't block lower-priority work.

        Concurrent Mode: Concurrent Mode is an experimental feature built on top of the Fiber architecture. It allows React to work on 
        multiple tasks concurrently and to pause and resume rendering as needed. This feature is particularly useful for building applications 
        that require real-time updates and prioritizing critical user interactions.

        Error Handling: React Fiber improves error handling by making it easier to capture and report errors without crashing the entire 
        application. This results in a more stable and robust application.

        Async Rendering: Fiber introduces the ability to work on rendering tasks asynchronously, which means React can split rendering work over
         multiple frames. This results in a smoother and more responsive user experience.

        React Fiber represents a significant step forward in the evolution of React's internal architecture. It allows React to handle the
         challenges of modern web applications with complex UIs, real-time updates, and interactive user experiences while maintaining a high level
          of performance and responsiveness. 


(8)** What is Config driven UI ?

            A "config-driven UI" (User Interface) refers to a user interface design or development approach where the structure and 
            behavior of the user interface are primarily defined and controlled through configuration files or data, rather than being
             hard-coded in the application's source code. This approach separates the UI configuration from the application logic, 
             making it more flexible, customizable, and easier to maintain. Config-driven UIs are commonly used in various contexts,
              including web applications, mobile apps, and software systems. Here are some key aspects of a config-driven UI:

(9) Why do we need Keys in React ? when do we need Keys in React ?

        In summary, keys in React are crucial for optimizing the rendering and reconciliation of lists of components or elements. 
        They enable React to efficiently track changes, preserve component state, and maintain a stable element identity, resulting
         in a smoother and more reliable user interface.

(10) what is Props in react ?

        props are nothing but arguments in normal javascript function , we use props when we want to send data from one component to another component

(11) Can we use Index as a key in react ?

        It was ok to use index as a key in react , However it is not recommended to use index as a key because whenever a change in the list happens 
        react confuses and it might cause unnecessary rendering issues and also impacts on performance of the React application
