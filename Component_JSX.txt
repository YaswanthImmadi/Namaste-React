        JSX stands for "JavaScript XML." It is a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React, a popular
         JavaScript library for building user interfaces. JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code within their
          JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manage the structure and content of web pages or user 
          interfaces.

        Here's a simple example of JSX:
        const heading=<h1>Namaste React , Welcome to JSX</h1>

(3) what is the type attribute in script tag , what options can i use along with type attribute ?

        The type attribute in the <script> tag is used to specify the type or language of the script being executed. 
        It tells the browser how to interpret and execute the content inside the <script> element. 
        the type attribute is optional in HTML5, but it's good practice to include it for clarity and compatibility

        (default)Javascript 
        moddule
        aplication/JSON
        text/css
        text/ecmascript-6
